Group members: Nathan Beneke and Courtney Cook

Initial Ideas: 
      Things I'd need to do:
          ring up individual items
          enter amount of particular items bought (if buying six lamps, scan one and multiply by six instead of scanning six)
          sort purchases (group items by home, clothing, food, media, etc)
          remove incorrectly scanned item
          total up the cost
          enter name of cashier?
          find time of transaction?
          apply discounts/coupons?
          update amount of items in inventory (decrease by however many the customer is buying)
          track how products were purchased? (check, card, cash, etc)
          log time in/ time out (hours worked)
          
          
      Things the company (?) would need to do
          return an item
          exchange an item
          change/update items in inventory
          change/update prices
          update amount of items in inventory (order more when running out)
          track employee name, DOB, wage, maybe how long they've worked (and maybe how much they've worked and earned)
          schedule workers? (and therefore, keep track of when employees can and cannot work)
          send out pay? (multiply wage by hours worked and assign to the correct employee)
